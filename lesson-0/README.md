# Install Required Tools üì¶
Install `dotnet` [version 6 or greater](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/sdk-for-vs-code).

Then install `dotnet-script` with the following command in a command prompt/terminal:
```
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script
```

> Hint: you can open a terminal in vscode using `Menu -> Terminal -> New Terminal` or just use a regular command prompt/terminal.

# Download tutorial-2
You should download the full contents of `tutorial-2` to your computer.

> Hint: you might find it helpful to open vscode in the current lesson's directory (instead of the root `tutorial-2` directory). You can do this with `Menu -> File -> Open Folder...` and selecting the lesson directory you want to work on.

# Draw.io or PlantUMLüå±
This tutorial uses [draw.io](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/wiki/draw.io) to draw state machine diagrams, but you can also use [PlantUML](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/wiki/PlantUML) to create the diagrams. Apart from the diagramming tool, the rest of the tutorial is the same for either.

StateSmith generates source code from your state machine diagram. In this tutorial, the diagrams are already drawn for you so you can learn quickly. Feel free to modify them and run the code generation again.
