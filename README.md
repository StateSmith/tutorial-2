# See Newer Tutorials?
If you are new to StateSmith, you probably want one of the newer tutorials.<br>
See https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/wiki/Learning-Resources

This older tutorial shows how to use .csx files with StateSmith. In 2024, I only recommend using .csx files if you need very advanced features of StateSmith like custom modding the state machine graph just before code gen.

# Dark/Light Theme
All of these diagrams were drawn in dark mode. If you are using a light theme and notice any issues with the diagrams, please let me know.

In vscode, you can switch between between light/dark from the command palette. `Ctrl+Shift+P` and then type `dark`. In the draw.io offline app, you can switch between light/dark by clicking the sun or moon icon in the top right.
