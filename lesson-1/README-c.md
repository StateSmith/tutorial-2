# See Plugin How To Use Guide
The [Plugin How To Use Guide](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith-drawio-plugin/wiki/How-To-Use) has lots of good tips with animated gifs.

# Add Another State
The [How To Use guide](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith-drawio-plugin/wiki/How-To-Use) covers this in more detail, so we will be brief here.

Copy state `ON1` and rename it to `ON2`. Add transitions between the states.

![](./docs/add-state-on2.gif)





<br>

# Add Transition Events
Select the transition from `ON1` to `ON2` and press `F2` to edit the transition label. Type in `INCREASE`.

Edit the other transition's label to be `DIM`.

# Save and Generate
Save the file, and run the code generation again.
```
dotnet-script code_gen.csx
```
You should see the following:
```
StateSmith Runner - Compiling file: `LightSm.drawio.svg` (no state machine name specified).
StateSmith Runner - State machine `LightSm` selected.
StateSmith Runner - Writing to file `LightSm.js`.
StateSmith Runner - Finished normally.
```

Notice that our state machine now has a state for `ON2`.

# draw.io Bugs üêõ
draw.io is a super awesome application, but it does have some bugs. Luckily, we can often have our plugin overcome them. Thank you open source!

If you run into an issue specific to draw.io, check our [draw.io plugin repo for issues](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith-drawio-plugin/issues) and/or report there.

One draw.io vscode extension (not draw.io offline app) bug that you will likely bump into is that you should [exit all groups before saving](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith-drawio-plugin/issues/25). Otherwise, draw.io will create an svg that is valid and can be used by StateSmith, but doesn't view properly.

There's also a [troubleshooting section](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith-drawio-plugin/wiki/Troubleshooting) you can consult.




<br>

# Test It In The Browser üåç
Same as before. Open `index.html` in a browser and send events to your state machine using the buttons.
